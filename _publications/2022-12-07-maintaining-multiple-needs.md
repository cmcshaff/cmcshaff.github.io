This is the first paper of my PhD, and demonstrates that due to the nonlinear interactions within behavioral and metabolic dynamics, we cannot determine whether an organism will remain viable by testing its responses in fixed conditions. What makes conditions survivable or not is not inherent, but comes from how they stand relative to one another and how the organism traverses across adjacent possibilities.
